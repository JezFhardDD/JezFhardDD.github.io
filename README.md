# JezFhardDD

Hi — I'm JezFhardDD. I'm a software developer and creator who enjoys building across systems, games, and the web. I work with low-level languages, modern app stacks, and design tools to ship complete projects from concept to deployment.

## Skills

- Languages: C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Dart, C#, GDScript (also familiar with HTML)
- Frameworks & Libraries: Vue, React, Flutter, Spring Boot, Laravel (also familiar with Tailwind CSS)
- Tools & Environment: Git, VS Code, Docker, VMware, Linux, Aseprite, Canva, Figma, SketchUp

## What I build

- Web applications (frontend with Vue/React, backend with Spring Boot or Laravel)
- Mobile apps with Flutter
- Games and prototypes with Godot (GDScript)
- Native/low-level systems and utilities in C/C++
- Art, UI and assets using Aseprite and design tools

## Highlights

- Comfortable across the full stack: from low-level C/C++ work to modern JavaScript frontends and backend services
- Designer-friendly: I create and adapt assets using Aseprite, Figma, and Canva
- DevOps-aware: I use Docker and Linux for development and deployment workflows
